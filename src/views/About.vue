      <p>Webber is a database for movies and TV shows was developed as a personal project in January 2022. <br>
         The goal of this project was to learn the basics of VueJS 3 and SCSS, while also improving on my design skills.<br><br>
         The data used for the app is being retrieved with AJAX calls from "The Movie Database API v3".</p>
